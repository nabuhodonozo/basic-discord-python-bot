# discord-python-bot
In my free time I am developing python bot for learning purposes. 
Curently it's in early beta.
Bot is working on my gaming server where I play only with my friends.
  (here is another bot that I am working on with friends. But it's private on our own gitlab. So this project is stoped)

* Promoting members
* deleting messages from channel
