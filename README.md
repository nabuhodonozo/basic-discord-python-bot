# discord-python-bot
In my free time I am developing python bot for learning purposes.
Bot is working on my gaming server where I play with my friends.

THIS PROJECT WAS DISCONTINUED, DUE TO SWITCH TO PRIVATE REPO JAVA BOT. After this time discord.py has drastically changed and this code might not work.

Features:

* Adding numbers
* Help command
* Promoting members
* deleting messages from channel


## Test.py
* Event announcement
* Ability to queue members
* reminders
* time based bans/mutes



# Requirements

* https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
* python3
* discord application
* discord server
